# format
#    SIG    name [ name ]*
#    SIGd   name [ name ]*
#  Notes:
#    signal order is significant
#    SIG is the same as SIG1, a 1 bit signal
#    name can be an _ which is a 0 bit signal non-unique name inserted for readability
#
#    CONST   name [ name ]      # defines constants 0, 1, ...
#
#   using signals:  name   or name=num
#     signal ranges are not checked, num can be a number or a defined constant
#     order of using signals is irrelevant
#     signal list end at EOL (end of line)
#     upc is advanced at EOL
#     
#
#   mnemonic OPCODE  <bit pattern>
#    bit pattern must be casex acceptible (with ? and _)
#
#    label: <EOL>    # defines a uaddr constant with value of upc
#
# Note that symbols with names starting with UC_ will have their
# names and values written to the sig_declare file
# If you want a microcode address constant, this is how you access
# it from verilog. (other than the constants in the instruction decoder)
#
#
# Signals:
#

#only some signals are defined for you already
#You must add whatever microcode signals you use
