GCC & GAS
=========
- GCC is the GNU C compiler, the one we will be using to compile C to machine code
- GCC also uses an assembler, which we can access directly called GAS
- To run these on windows its (IMO) easier just to use WSL

WSL
===
- Windows Subsystem for Linux, this is just a lighweight virtual machine for windows that runs linux
- Very easy install, just get it off the microsoft store
- there is a vscode extension that will allow you to run the wsl terminal in vscodes consol window

Usage
=====
riscv64-unknown-elf-as -march=rv32im test.s -o test.o
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d test.o
