GCC & GAS
=========
- GCC is the GNU C compiler, the one we will be using to compile C to machine code
- GCC also uses an assembler, which we can access directly called GAS
- To run these on windows its (IMO) easier just to use WSL

WSL
===
- Windows Subsystem for Linux, this is just a lighweight virtual machine for windows that runs linux
- Very easy install, just get it off the microsoft store
- there is a vscode extension that will allow you to run the wsl terminal in vscodes consol window

Usage
=====
riscv64-unknown-elf-as -march=rv32im test.s -o test.o; riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d test.o

NOTICE: use bash script for updated command (dm chris for questions)

Questia
=======
in gui, change directory to git directory
in questia cmd, cd into modules

NOTICE: use powershell script for updated command (dm chris for questions)

Writing asm
===========
the .s file ONLY expects labels in the jal and jalr, so if i give it
jal ra, 0x10, it thinks 0x10 is a lable, and not an offset or absolute address, it then sees that that label doesnt exist
so it then interprets that label to point to the current instruction, that is the jal or jalr. when we objdump it will give 
us the absolute address that the instruction will actually jump to, which is the location of the jal/jalr instruciton in memmory

RUNNING OLD TESTBENCH (WARNING - MAY BE OUT OF DATE)
This command will run the old test bench (from last semester) and output the results into the "sim.log" file. Please be aware the old testbench
could be behind the new testbench. However, I chose to leave it in case we need a backup for whatever reason. Thanks to Chris for the original
command. - Edgar

vsim -c -do "file delete -force sim.log; transcript file sim.log; vlog *.sv; vsim -voptargs=+acc work.self_checking_cpu_tb; run 5us; quit -f"
